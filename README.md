## How to Make a Prediction - Intro to Deep Learning #1

Welcome to Intro to Deep Learning! This course is for anyone who wants to become a deep learning engineer. I'll take you from the very basics of deep learning to the bleeding edge over the course of 4 months. In this video, we’ll predict an animal’s body weight given it’s brain weight using linear regression via 10 lines of Python. I’ll have a live session every Wednesday at 10 AM PST that covers my weekly video topics in depth. You can click on the little notification bell next to the subscribe button to get an email notification whenever I’m live. And each session is recorded and uploaded to this channel in case you miss it. This Youtube content is 100% created by me (from the writing to the editing, etc.) , it’ll all be released on my channel, and it’s totally free.

I am also very proud and excited to announce my new, exclusive partnership with Udacity. Together, we’re offering the new Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation program. If you want to take your game to the next level, this is for you! Especially since Udacity will be providing guaranteed admission to their groundbreaking Artificial Intelligence and Self-Driving Car Nanodegree programs to all graduates. They’re offering discounted limited-time pricing, so enroll now to enjoy the unique projects, program sets, and expert reviews. Plus, their community is amazing, so don’t forget to join the Slack channel after you enroll (I’ll be in there too!) And hey, I’m getting paid a small royalty from each enrollment, so let’s do this together!

## How to Do Linear Regression using Gradient Descent

The point of this is to demonstrate the concept of gradient descent. Gradient descent is the most popular optimization strategy in deep learning, in particular an implementation of it called backpropagation. We are using gradient descent as our optimization strategy for linear regression. We'll draw the line of best fit to measure the relationship between student test scores and the amount of hours studied.

## How to Make a Neural Network - Intro to Deep Learning #2

How do we learn? In this video, I'll discuss our brain's biological neural network, then we'll talk about how an artificial neural network works. We'll create our own single layer feedforward network in Python, demo it, and analyze the implications of our results. This is the 2nd weekly video in my intro to deep learning series (Udacity nanodegree)

## How to Do Sentiment Analysis - Intro to Deep Learning #3

In this video, we'll use machine learning to help classify emotions! The example we'll use is classifying a movie review as either positive or negative via TF Learn in 20 lines of Python.

## How to Do Mathematics Easily - Intro to Deep Learning #4

Let's learn about some key math concepts behind deep learning shall we? We'll build a 3 layer neural network and dive into some key concepts that makes deep learning give us such incredible results.
