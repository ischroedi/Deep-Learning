## How to Do Linear Regression using Gradient Descent

The point of this is to demonstrate the concept of gradient descent. Gradient descent is the most popular optimization strategy in deep learning, in particular an implementation of it called backpropagation. We are using gradient descent as our optimization strategy for linear regression. We'll draw the line of best fit to measure the relationship between student test scores and the amount of hours studied.
